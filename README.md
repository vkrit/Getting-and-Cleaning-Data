# Getting & Cleaning Data - Course Project

The script run_analysis.R clean the data. It does the following:

### 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

- The training and testing dataset are first read into two variables, *train* and *test*, respectively
- The training & testing dataset are then merged using rbind into a single variable named *all*

Notes:
- In the first part of the code, I only merged X_train & X_test. y_train and y_test, subject_train, subject_test are merged into *all* later in part 3 for coding convenience.

### 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

- First the list of all feature names are read into variable *features*
- Then the features with mean and standard deviation are found using regular expression. The column indices are stored in variable *good_columns*
- Variable *all* is subsetted with *good_columns*

Notes:
- In here I extracted 66 columns. There are columns "meanFreq" that I purposely excluded. Only columns that has "mean()" and "std()" in its name are included

### 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set and 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 

- First the English names of the activites are read into variable *activity_labels*.
- Then *activity_labels* are used to labels y_train and y_test, and then merged into *all*
- Next, subject are read and merged into *subject_all*
- Finally, *subject_all* is merged into *all*. After this step, *all* contains all the information that we need to merge

### 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

- The average are calculated using function aggregate. The result is stored in variable *tidy* which will be then stored into a file named "tidy_data.txt"
- *tidy* has 180 rows. This is because: There are 30 subject and 6 activities, thus there are 30*6 = 180 averages for each variable.
